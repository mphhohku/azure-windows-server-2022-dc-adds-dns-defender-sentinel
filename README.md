# DNS, DHCP, AD DS, and Cloud Security on Azure Windows Server 2022

## Introduction
This is a project built from scratch to go through the setup of DNS, DHCP, AD DS and cloud security tools Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender for Cloud on Azure Windows Server 2022.

This project is aided by GitHub Copilot in its construction and documentation.

## Main features
- Azure Virtual Machine

## Reflections
### Major hiccups and mitigation
- Section 1: Since this VM will be cleaned up after the labs, so I will use a faster VM size, Standard D2s v3, instead of the B1s, which would make Server Manager crash.

### Future improvement
- Azure DNS as an alternative to Windows DNS
- Automation
